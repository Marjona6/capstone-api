# Mars Photo Explorer
API capstone project for Thinkful's Front-End Web Development course. Mars Photo Explorer is a web app that allows users to explore images of Mars taken by NASA's three Mars rovers--Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity--using NASA's Open API (https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#MarsPhotos).
## Introduction
Mars Photo Explorer lets you view images of the surface of Mars taken by NASA's Mars rovers. You can search by Earth date and view photos taken from the time the rovers began collecting data up until the present day (for Opportunity and Curiosity--the Spirit rover's mission ended on May 25, 2011 after it became stuck in some soft soil).
## Summary
Mars Photo Explorer uses NASA's Mars Photos Open API to let users search for and view images of Mars in an intuitive, straightforward, and easy to use way. The app is responsive, letting users view and use it on mobile devices as well as larger screens. Users can search for photos by selecting one of the three rovers, choosing an Earth date and one of the rover's multiple cameras, and clicking "Search." Photos are displayed as thumbnails, which users can click to open as full-size images in a new window.
## Technology
Mars Photo Explorer uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.
